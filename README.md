# pss13_discordbot

Needs Node.js.

Before using:
 - Install the dependecies by opening a shell at the source directory and using the command "npm install"

To turn on the bot, open shell at source directory and use the command "node bot.js".

This bot is purely made for Persistence SS13 official server and may not be supported in any other servers. It is purely tied to PSS13's discord_hook module.
Most things should probably be very hardcoded to work on PSS13's official discord server AND game server.
